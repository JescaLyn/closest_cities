# Closest Cities

This is a simple program that is intended to calculate the two closest cities from a list. The method `closest_cities` can be used to find the closest two addresses from an array of any addresses. By default, the method is called on a hardcoded `CITIES` constant.

## Instructions to Run

1) Clone or download this directory.
2) Run "bundle install" in the terminal at the top-level.
3) Run "ruby closest_cities.rb" to output the closest cities in the terminal, or require "closest_cities.rb" in another file to use the return value of the function `closest_cities`.
